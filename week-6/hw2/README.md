### Homework 2

Homework 2 is some web scraping and creating a RAG pattern to answer some questions using the Presidential Proclamations which can be found [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamations/)

Use the RAG_HW2.ipynb to complete the homework answering all questions in that notebook. You can use whatever python instance as long as its 3.11 or above. I had success completing using both colaboratory and the docker jupyter_build env seen in week 4 and wee 5 

You will need to create a Google API key in Google AI studio to be able to use Gemini Flash 2 [https://aistudio.google.com/u/2/apikey]

This will be due in 1 week on Friday May 16 again as a pull request sent to the 'hw2-submissions' branch underneath the week-6/hw2/ directory. Add your name to your file submission so it is clear on whose homework is whose. Thanks!
