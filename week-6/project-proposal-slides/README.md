### Proposal Presentation (From final presentation page) 

TO REITERATE: Slide submissions for the proposal presentation will be available until **11:59 am May 6, 2025**. Create a pull request to the corresponding Github directory. 

There is a proposal presentation component that will happen during week 6 for 3-4 minutes each. No more or no less. There will be a maximum of 4 slides; 1 title slide and then 3 with content. This should only show your work in attaining a dataset, light exploratory data analysis, and a proposal of what you intend to do with the data and what 'product' you might build (this can change by the final presentation, so don't work if you aren't 100% sure with what you want to do). Order of presentations will be randomized. 

To that end you will need to start collecting your data prior to week six. Create your project GitHub repo. Both week 3 and 4 have shown different methods to collect data from websites.  Adapt these methods to do so for your project. It may not be the case that you have completed your data collection at this point but be well on your way to doing so.
