# Homework 3

Create a standalone github repo called `Mtcars Flask Api`. Use the mtcars.csv dataset to create a predictive linear model using `mpg` as a response and any (or all) other remaining variables as predictors using Python in a Docker container. 

With the predictive model create a flask API (first locally) that is functional using a Docker container, push the image to DockerHub, and then deploy to Google Cloud Run. Someone else should be able to stumble across your repo, clone it, and reproduce.

This github repo should contain a README explaining what is included in the repo and what is being done.

There should also be directions (possibly in another README in another directory) on how to standup your API. Provide an example input and output (as curl command), so that if I run, calling the API, I will get the same results when I call your deployed model.

To submit, create a separate markdown file simple with your name and title of this homework that is a link to your repo. Name this file `<your-name>_hw3.md` and create a pull request to the week-7 homework submission directory under the homework3-submission branch. 

This is due Week 8, May 22, 2025 at 6pm.
