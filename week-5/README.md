## Week 5
---------
### Week Overview
This week will see the closet we will come to 'modeling' in this course, but in actuality taking advantage of existing models (LLMs) and tailoring them to our specific needs and seeing varying applications of them outside of commonly used consumer facing applications like ChatGPT, Gemini, or DeepSeek.  

Introduction to Vector Databases, Retrieval Augemented Generation (RAG), LangChain (and Llamaindex, briefly) and possibly Ollama.

### Project Proposal
--------
Next week will start with project proposal, followed by short lecture. The presentation order will be randomized. There will be a new 'project-proposal' branch where your slides should be submitted through a pull request from your forked repo from another new branch.
